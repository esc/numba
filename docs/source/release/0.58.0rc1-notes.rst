operating systems.

(`PR-#9083 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/9083>`__)


New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~


Added towncrier
"""""""""""""""

This PR adds towncrier as a GitHub workflow for checking release notes. 
From this PR onwards every PR made in Numba will require a appropriate
release note associated with it. The reviewer may decide to skip adding
release notes in smaller PRs with minimal impact by addition of a
``skip_release_notes`` label to the PR.

(`PR-#8792 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/8792>`__)

``numba.experimental.jitclass`` gains support for ``__*matmul__`` methods.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

``numba.experimental.jitclass`` now has support for the following methods:

* ``__matmul__``
* ``__imatmul__``
* ``__rmatmul__``

(`PR-#8892 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/8892>`__)

``numba.experimental.jitclass`` gains support for reflected "dunder" methods.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

``numba.experimental.jitclass`` now has support for the following methods:

* ``__radd__``
* ``__rand_``
* ``__rfloordiv__``

(`PR-#8906 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/8906>`__)


Added RVSDG-frontend
====================

This PR is a preliminary work on adding a RVSDG-frontend for processing 
bytecode. RVSDG (Regionalized Value-State Dependence Graph) allows us to
have a dataflow-centric view instead of a traditional SSA-CFG view. This
allows us to simplify the compiler in the future.

(`PR-#9012 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/9012>`__)


Add np.trim_zeros
=================

Support for ``np.trim_zeros()`` is added.

(`PR-#9074 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/9074>`__)


Add support for value ``max`` to ``NUMBA_OPT``.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The optimisation level that Numba applies when compiling can be set through the
environment variable ``NUMBA_OPT``. This has historically been a value between
0 and 3 (inclusive). Support for the value ``max`` has now been added, this is a
Numba-specific optimisation level which indicates that the user would like Numba
to try running the most optimisation possible, potentially trading a longer
compilation time for better run-time performance. In practice, use of the ``max``
level of optimisation may or may not benefit the run-time or compile-time
performance of user code, but it has been added to present an easy to access
option for users to try if they so wish.

(`PR-#9094 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/9094>`__)


Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Updates to ``numba.core.pythonapi``.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

``PyBytes_AsStringAndSize`` is added to ``numba.core.pythonapi.PythonAPI`` as
``bytes_as_string`` and ``bytes_as_string_and_size`` methods respectively.

(`PR-#8462 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/8462>`__)

Support for ``isinstance`` is now non-experimental.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Support for the ``isinstance`` built-in function has moved from being considered
an experimental feature to a fully supported feature.

``numpy.convolve`` are now supported.

(`PR-#7543 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/7543>`__)

``@vectorize`` accommodates arguments implementing ``__array_ufunc__``.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Universal functions (``ufunc``\ s) created with ``numba.vectorize`` will now
respect arguments implementing ``__array_ufunc__`` (NEP-13) to allow pre- and
post-processing of arguments and return values when the ufunc is called from the
interpreter.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

Handling of different sized unsigned integer indexes are fixed in ``numba.typed.List``.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

An issue with the order of truncation/extension and casting of unsigned integer
indexes in ``numba.typed.List`` has been fixed.

(`PR-#7262 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/7262>`__)

Prevent invalid fusion
""""""""""""""""""""""

This PR fixes an issue in which an array first read in a parfor and later
written in the same parfor would only be classified as used in the parfor.
When a subsequent parfor also used the same array then fusion of the
parfors was happening which should have been forbidden given that that the
first parfor was also writing to the array.  This PR treats such arrays
in a parfor as being both used and defined so that fusion will be prevented.

(`PR-#7582 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/7582>`__)

The ``numpy.allclose`` implementation now correctly handles default arguments.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The implementation of ``numpy.allclose`` is corrected to use ``TypingError`` to
report typing errors.

(`PR-#8885 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/8885>`__)

Add type validation to ``numpy.isclose``.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Type validation is added to the implementation of ``numpy.isclose``.

(`PR-#8944 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/8944>`__)

Fix support for overloading dispatcher with non-compatible first-class functions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Fixes an error caused by not handling compilation error during casting of 
``Dispatcher`` objects into first-class functions. With the fix, users can now
overload a dispatcher with non-compatible first-class functions. Refer to
https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/9071 for details.

(`PR-#9072 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/9072>`__)

Support `dtype` keyword argument in `numpy.arange` with `parallel=True`
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Fixes parfors transformation to support the use of `dtype` keyword argument in 
``numpy.arange(..., dtype=dtype)``.

(`PR-#9095 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/9095>`__)

Fix all ``@overload``\ s to use parameter names that match public APIs.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Some of the Numba ``@overload``\ s for functions in NumPy and Python's built-ins
were written using parameter names that did not match those used in API they
were overloading. The result of this being that calling a function with such a
mismatch using the parameter names as key-word arguments at the call site would
result in a compilation error. This has now been universally fixed throughout
the code base and a unit test is running with a best-effort attempt to prevent
reintroduction of similar mistakes in the future. Fixed functions include:

From Python built-ins:

* ``complex``

From the Python ``random`` module:

* ``random.seed``
* ``random.gauss``
* ``random.normalvariate``
* ``random.randrange``
* ``random.randint``
* ``random.uniform``
* ``random.shuffle``

From the ``numpy`` module:

* ``numpy.argmin``
* ``numpy.argmax``
* ``numpy.array_equal``
* ``numpy.average``
* ``numpy.count_nonzero``
* ``numpy.flip``

* ``numpy.flipud``

* ``numpy.imag``
* ``numpy.real``
* ``numpy.reshape``
* ``numpy.rot90``
* ``numpy.swapaxes``
* ``numpy.union1d``
* ``numpy.unique``

From the ``numpy.linalg`` module:

* ``numpy.linalg.norm``
* ``numpy.linalg.cond``
* ``numpy.linalg.matrix_rank``

From the ``numpy.random`` module:

Changes
~~~~~~~

Support for ``@numba.extending.intrinsic(prefer_literal=True)``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In the high level extension API, the ``prefer_literal`` option is added to the
``numba.extending.intrinsic`` decorator to prioritize the use of literal types
when available. This has the same behavior as in the ``prefer_literal``
option in the ``numba.extending.overload`` decorator.

(`PR-#6647 <https://github.com/numba/numba/pull/6647>`__)

The minimum ``llvmlite`` version is now 0.41.0.
